# Chatter

I made this project since I thought it would be a good exercise to practice some aspects of full-stack development.
This application uses Node Express and MongoDB on the backend, and the classic html, CSS, and JavaScript combo on the frontend.

This is what I can still implement:
[] - Login System
[] - Display error message when user enters erroneous input
[] - Allow one to search for specific topics
[] - Add an event listener for clicking on the posts
[] - A whole lot more...
