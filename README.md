# Chatter

I made this project since I thought it would be a good exercise to practice some aspects of full-stack development.
This application uses Node Express and MongoDB on the backend, and the classic html, CSS, and JavaScript combo on the frontend.
As of now, people can simply type in their name and post what's on their mind. These posts would be stored in an MongoDB Atlas cluster if the app was deployed, otherwise it relies on the fact that you have MongoDB on your machine if you decide to download and run the app yourself. 

## How to run the program
To run the backend, cd into the server folder and in your terminal run "npm start". Then, in a separate tab or window, cd into the client folder and run "live-server" and you should be able to see the front-end. 

This is what I can still implement:
- Login System
- Display error message when user enters erroneous input
- Allow one to search for specific topics
- Add an event listener for clicking on the posts
- A whole lot more...
